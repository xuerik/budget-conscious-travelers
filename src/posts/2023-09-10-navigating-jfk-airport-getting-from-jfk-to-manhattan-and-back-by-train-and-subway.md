Hey there, travelers! Are you planning a trip to the Big Apple and wondering how to get from JFK Airport to Manhattan and back? Well, you're in luck because I'm here to share my personal experience and tips on how to do just that using the train and subway.

First, let's talk about the various transportation options to and from JFK International Airport. There are several ways to get from JFK to Manhattan, including taxis, Uber, Lyft, and private car services. But if you're looking for a more affordable and convenient option, consider taking the AirTrain and the subway (MTA).

## AirTrain
The train option is the JFK AirTrain, which is a direct train that runs from JFK Airport to Penn Station in Manhattan. The train is easy to find, and the journey takes around 30 minutes. From Penn Station, you can take a subway to your final destination.

After landing at JFK, I took the AirTrain which conveniently connects right in the airport terminals. It's a quick 5 minute automated ride to the Jamaica station where I then transferred to the E subway line into Manhattan. The E train took about 45 minutes to get to Midtown. It was definitely longer than a taxi would be, but so much cheaper!

I enjoyed watching the slices of neighborhood life pass by the subway windows. We snaked above and below ground, zooming through tunnels and over bridges before finally arriving at my stop on 5th Avenue. After checking into the hotel, I grabbed a bagel and strolled through Central Park - I had made it to the city!

## Subway
Now, let's talk about the subway option. You can take the 7 subway train from JFK Airport to Manhattan. The 7 train runs from JFK Airport to Times Square, which is located in the heart of Manhattan. The journey takes around 45 minutes, and the fare is around $3.

So, which option should you choose? It depends on your personal preference and your final destination. If you're traveling with a lot of luggage or want a more direct route, the JFK AirTrain might be the better option. However, if you're looking for a more affordable option and don't mind a longer journey, the 7 subway train is a great choice.

## Tips
Now that you know your options, here are some tips for making the most of your train and subway ride:

Plan ahead: Before you leave for the airport, check the schedules and fares for both the JFK AirTrain and the 7 subway train. This will help you plan your trip and avoid any surprises.
Allow plenty of time: Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get to the airport and clear security before your flight. I recommend arriving at the airport at least 2 hours before your flight.
Use the MTA app: The MTA app is a lifesaver for navigating the subway system. You can use it to plan your route, check train schedules, and even pay your fare.
Be prepared for crowds: Both the train and subway can be crowded during rush hour, so be prepared to push your way through crowds and stand for a while.
Enjoy the views: The JFK AirTrain offers great views of the city, so take a moment to enjoy the view as you ride in.
Overall, taking the train and subway from JFK Airport to Manhattan and back is a convenient and affordable option. With a little planning and preparation, you'll be able to navigate the system like a pro and enjoy your trip to the Big Apple. Happy travels!
