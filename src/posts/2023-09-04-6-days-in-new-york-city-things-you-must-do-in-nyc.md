New York City, also famously known as "The Big Apple", is a place that everyone must visit at least once in their lifetime. The city is rich with history, architecture, and amazingly delicious food from all around the world. May and I went on a 6 day trip this Spring (April) and we'll share with you all the things you must do, places you must see, and the food you must eat!

## Pre-trip Preparations

#### Booking our flight

We booked our 6 day trip from LAX to JFK about 5 weeks out from the departure date. It originally costed $380 (one-way) for both of us and we intended to go only for 5 days. 

##### Tip #1: Maximize Vacation Time
If you're flying from the West Coast to the East Coast, book red-eye flight.

> Red eye flights are flights that depart late at night (past 9 PM).

The reason behind this is that the flight itself is about 5-6 hours and combined with 2-3 hours of timezone changes, it totals to 7-9 hours passed in the destination's local time. 

If you're flying out at 9-10 PM or later, you will likely arrive in the early morning which is perfect way to start your day! This also assumes that you can sleep easily on planes and aren't bothered by cabin noises and crying babies. 

Invest in a good set of noise-cancelling headphones. I hear the [Sony WH-1000XM5](https://amzn.to/3sDTRAz) headphones are pretty good.

#### Rescheduling our flight to extend our trip by a day

But after much consideration combined with the fact that it's a **long** flight (~5 hours, 30 minutes) and that May wouldn't have flexibility in her schedule to go on a trip next year, we eventually made the decision to extend our trip by an additional day. 

We had booked our flight through the Chase Travel portal but there were very limited options on the website to reschedule our flight. From our experience, we knew that calling in to the help center and talking to an actual person would yield better service. After waiting on hold for some time, we were finally connected to a travel specialist. 

Because our departure date was still slightly over 2 weeks away, the specialist was able to make changes to our reservation for us but at the cost of an additional $80 resulting in a total of $460 for 2 people. Remember, this is the price for one-way flights! I'll explain a bit later why we did **not** book roundtrip flights.

I was not quite satisfied paying $230/person/one-way flight, but unfortunately this was the only time in the year that May had free time in her schedule üò≠. According to [Google Flights price tracker](https://www.google.com/travel/flights?hl=en-US), the typical price ranges between $300-$400 roundtrip/person this time of the year so we did end up overpaying a bit. 

#### Tip #2: Save money by using credit card cash back rewards

But I was prepared for such a situation and I had cash back reward points saved up from using my Chase Freedom Flex and Freedom Unlimited credit cards. Instead of shelling out $460 out of pocket, I redeemed 36,800 points (100 points = $1) instead. 

Now you're probably wondering why it didn't cost 46,000 points and that is because the [Chase Sapphire Preferred](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6j/OCD838ZVKE) credit card lets you redeem points with an additional 25% value for every point. It's essentially a 25% discount on! Isn't that great! ü§†

### Things to bring and pack up

#### Luggages

We have been using an American Tourister carry-on luggage that we bought 5 years ago that's still in great condition! It has a plastic shell that makes it easy to clean up compared to the fabric-based luggages, and it also has a built-in TSA lock making it super simple to protect your belongings. I'm not able to find the exact link to it on Amazon, but here's a very similar [carry-on luggage from Coolife](https://amzn.to/45MNIQW) that has over 10,000 reviews ü§Ø! 

#### Toiletries

Since both of our flights to and from NYC only allowed 1 carry-on per person, we had to be creative with packing up our belongings. 

##### Tip #3: Get transparent bags/pouches for toiletries
I highly recommend using transparent toiletry bags such as the one below to carry tooth brushes, shaver, and mini [travel bottles](https://amzn.to/45MOhu2) for body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. 

We bought ours locally from Daiso, but the one linked here should work just as well!

Whenever we travel, we always like to play it safe and bring our own toiletries because you don't want to deal with the hassle of finding AND going to a department store while on vacation. 

> For men, clip your nails before flying, and you'll have one less thing to bring!

#### DIY First Aid Kit
We also bring a DIY first-aid kit consisting of bandages, antibiotic ointment, tylenol, and anti-diarrheal just in case something goes wrong! You never know when you might need it.

#### Clothing, Accessories

For me personally, these are the type of clothing and accessories that I brought:
- 1 t-shirt per day
- 1 pair of jeans and/or comfortable trousers
- 1 pair of socks and undergarments per day
- 1 foldable, compressible jacket
    - I have a Columbia rain and wind-proof jacket similar to [this](https://amzn.to/45COlwA) which I highly recommend
  - It's compact, keeps you warm and it looks good!
- 2 pairs of shoes (Nike running shoes, 1 pair of boots)
  - I knew I would be walking a lot, so definitely bring a comfortable pair of shoes
  - The boots are primarily to look nice in photos
- Sling bag for everyday carry (EDC)
  - Useful for carrying your phone, wallet, external battery, a water bottle and anything you expect to need while traveling

#### Electronics, Gadgets

Your phone without a doubt is essential, but I like to bring a *light* laptop (Macbook) with me for watching movies and relaxation after a long day of traveling. 

It also helps **a lot** when you need to do last minute planning such as researching things to eat and do the next few days. I like to make plans and have a sense of direction, but other folks may be more spontaneous and go with the flow üòù!

Here's what I brought on my trip:
- Laptop
- Charger for phone, laptop
- Camera
    - Cameras *used* to be necessary back in the day, when smartphone cameras were low quality. But, for Instagram, your phone is good enough.

##### Tip #4: External batteries (power bank) are a must
This is highly, highly recommend especially since you will be using Google Maps a lot for navigation. And for us, we use Apple Pay for most/all of our purchases.

##### Tip #5: "Cash is King"

> Most mom-and-pop restaurants in Flushing and Chinatown accept **cash only**. So break out your Benjamin's from the piggybank! 

On a serious note, smaller denominations ($5s, $10s, $20s), actually, are more convenient as some places may not have the necessary change.

### Heading to the airport

#### Transportation
When our family members and friends are too busy to take us to the aiport, we usually book an Uber or Lyft. We often find Uber rates to be slightly better, but just open both apps and compare pricing.

Note that both the Chase [Freedom Flex/Freedom Unlimited](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/18j/6G84Q2WADR) and [Sapphire Preferred](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6j/OCD838ZVKE) credit cards offer 5% cashback for Lyft, so this is something to take into account to get the most bang for your buck.


#### Timing Guidelines
For domestic flights, we strive to arrive to the airport at least 2 hours before the **departure time**. 

Our reasoning: 
- 30 minutes for getting tickets and checking in bags (if any)
- 30 minutes waiting in line for TSA
- 30 minutes to board on the plane
- And another 30 minute buffer just in case the lines turn out to be longer than predicted (Missing flights is not fun üòµ‚Äçüí´)

 If you're flying out of LAX or another busy airport, **plan for the worst**! It doesn't hurt to arrive early!

##### Tip #6: Airport Tricks to Save Time

**Airline Mobile Apps**
If you're handy with tech, download your airline's mobile app and check in from there to get your flight tickets. There's no need to wait in line.

**Going through TSA**
Have your REAL ID or Passport handy in an accessible location (front pockets if you're wearing pants) or somewhere in your bag you can quickly reach. You don't want to be fumbling around when you get to the agent. 

Additionally, put everything in your pockets into your backpack. This includes your phone, wallet, watch, AirPods, or whatever. **You just need your boarding pass and your ID!**

This is a system that I've developed over the years of traveling to make it convenient for myself, to reduce travel anxiety, and to expedite the security process!

### Arrival

#### Directions to the AirTrain
Since both May and I come from East Asian ancestry, our first stop in New York had to be Flushing! Flying into LaGuardia Airport would have been preferred since it's only 10 minutes away from Flushing but there weren't many flights from LAX to LGA and the prices were overall higher than flights to JFK. Because we were traveling light and also wanted to save money, we opted to take the AirTrain and New York MTA (metro/subway) instead of Uber, Lyft or via taxi.

From terminal 5, the direction to the AirTrain is actually on the 3rd or 4th floor, if I recall correctly. We had thought it was outside and wasted time aimlessly looking for it. If you decide to take the AirTrain, make sure to ask someone and follow signs!

![Sign showing direction to Skywalk at JFK International Airport](/blog/images/uploads/jfk-airtrain-sign.jpg "Sign showing direction to Skywalk at JFK International Airport")

On another note, there are 2 SkyTrain lines: red and green and *only* the green one was running on the day of the trip. Google Maps was telling us to take the red line so it was *unnecessarily* confusing to us why the red line wasn't running. However, we came to realize (after riding 1 stop too far) that we had to take the green line to Federal Circle first and then take transfer to the red line to get to Jamaica ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

There was a TV at the Lefferts Blvd stop showing the AirTrain's service map which is available [online](https://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/public-transportation). But it would have been incredibly helpful to tourists if this map was present in the earlier terminals or on the AirTrain itself...ü´† If someone from JFK Airport is reading this, please fix this!
![Map of AirTrain Service to Jamaica Station on a TV](/blog/images/uploads/directions-to-jamaica-station.jpg "Map of AirTrain Service to Jamaica Station on a TV")

#### Buying Metro Passes

After arriving at Jamaica Station, there is a $8.25 exit fee that you can purchase at either the ticketing machine (right) or at a news stand (left). We bought a 7-day unlimited Subway/Bus card ($33.00 + $1.00 fee) and a single-use AirTrain exit ticket ($8.25 + $1.00 fee) that costed $43.25 total per person. We had done research prior to the trip and discovered that OMNY (the mobile app for the metro/bus) has a maximum fare cap of $34.00 each week. 

![Map of AirTrain Service to Jamaica Station on a TV](/blog/images/uploads/metro-passes.jpg "Map of AirTrain Service to Jamaica Station on a TV")

##### Tip 7: Use OMNY (contactless payment) for the MTA (metro, bus)
As of August 20, 2023 this is no longer true: 
~~However, their 7-day period begins on Monday and ends on Sunday, so if your vacation begins in the middle of the week (say Wednesday) then the fare you've paid will reset once the week is over and you'll have to start accumulating toward the $34.00 all over again.~~ Because of this, we chose to buy the 7-day unlimited pass to keep things simple.

According to [OMNY's official website](https://omny.info/fares), the "7-day period" for the maximum fare cap can be started on any day now! This is great and makes it incredibly easy for tourist to decide whether to use OMNY or buy the 7-day unlimited pass as they are now equivalent. Great job, OMNY, for implementing this!

> Effective August 20, you can start any day of the week: pay for 12 rides in a 7-day period and any additional rides are free. And, unlike with MetroCard, you don‚Äôt have to pay upfront. Just tap and pay as you go.

##### Tip #8: Buy the 10-trip AirTrain JFK Pass

A mistake that we made was not buying the [10-trip AirTrain pass](https://bulkmetrocard.mta.info/products/10-trip-airtrain-jfk-only-metrocard) for $25.00. This works out to be $2.50/trip which is way less than the $8.25/per person exit fare that we paid at the news stand üò≠. Overall, we paid $8.25 x 4 = $33.00 total (roundtrip) for 2 people which is $8.00 more than we should've spent. 

If you and/or your travel companions plan to exceed more than 3 AirTrain trips, it is recommended to get the 10-trip pass which can be shared by everyone in your group.
