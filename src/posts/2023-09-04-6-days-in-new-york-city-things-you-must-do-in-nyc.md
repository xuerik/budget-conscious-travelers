Nï»¿ew York City, also famously known as "The Big Apple", is a place that everyone must visit at least once in their lifetime. The city is rich with history, architecture, and amazingly delicious food from all around the world. May and I went on a 6 day trip this Spring (April) and we'll share with you all the things you must do, places you must see, and the food you must eat!

## Pre-trip Preparations

### Booking our flight

We booked our 6 day trip from LAX to JFK about 5 weeks out from the departure date. It originally costed $380 (one-way) for both of us and we had intended to go only for 5 days. But after much consideration combined with the fact that it's a **long** flight (~5 hours, 30 minutes) and that May wouldn't have flexibility in her schedule to go on a trip next year, we eventually made the decision to extend our trip by an additional day. We had booked our flight through the Chase Travel portal but there were very limited options on the website to re-schedule our flight. From our experience, we knew that calling in to the help center and talking to an actual person would yield better service for us. After waiting on hold for some time, we were finally connected to a travel specialist. Because our departure date was slightly over 2 weeks away, the specialist was able to make changes to our reservation for us but at the cost of an additional $80 resulting in a total of $460 for 2 people. Remember, this is the price for one-way flights! I'll explain a bit later why we did **not** book roundtrip flights.
