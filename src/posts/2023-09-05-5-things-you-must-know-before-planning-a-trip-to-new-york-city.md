Planning a trip is almost always stressful, especially if you are someone who is meticulous about every little detail. I will be sharing 5 travel tips below that you need to know to prepare for your trip.

### Tip #1: Maximize Vacation Time
If you're flying from the West Coast to the East Coast, book a red-eye flight.

> Red eye flights are flights that depart late at night (past 9 PM).

The reason behind this is that the flight itself is about 5-6 hours and combined with 2-3 hours of timezone changes, it totals to 7-9 hours passed in the destination's local time. 

If you're flying out at 9-10 PM or later, you will likely arrive in the early morning which is perfect way to start your day! This also assumes that you can sleep easily on planes and aren't bothered by cabin noises and crying babies. 

Invest in a good set of noise-cancelling headphones. I hear the [Sony WH-1000XM5](https://amzn.to/3sDTRAz) headphones are pretty good.

### Tip #2: Save money by using credit card cash back rewards

May and I had a trip to New York City planned back in April and it would have costed us $460 total for 2 people one-way. Fortunately, I had cash back reward points saved up from using my Chase Freedom Flex and Freedom Unlimited credit cards. Instead of shelling out $460 out of pocket, I only had to redeem 36,800 points (100 points = $1) instead for the entire trip. 

Now you're probably wondering why it didn't cost 46,000 points and that is because the [Chase Sapphire Preferred](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6j/OCD838ZVKE) credit card lets you redeem points with an additional 25% value for every point. It's essentially a 25% discount on! Isn't that great! ü§†

### Tip #3: Get transparent bags/pouches for toiletries
Since both of our flights to and from NYC only allowed 1 carry-on per person, we had to be creative with packing up our belongings. 

I highly recommend using transparent toiletry bags such as the one below to carry tooth brushes, shaver, and mini [travel bottles](https://amzn.to/45MOhu2) for body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. 

We bought ours locally from Daiso, but the one linked here should work just as well!

Whenever we travel, we always like to play it safe and bring our own toiletries because you don't want to deal with the hassle of finding AND going to a department store while on vacation. 

> For men, clip your nails before flying, and you'll have one less thing to bring!

## Electronics, Gadgets

Your phone without a doubt is essential, but I like to bring a *light* laptop (Macbook) with me for watching movies and relaxation after a long day of traveling. 

It also helps **a lot** when you need to do last minute planning such as researching things to eat and do the next few days. I like to make plans and have a sense of direction, but other folks may be more spontaneous and go with the flow üòù!

### Tip #4: External/portable batteries (power bank) are a must
Portable battery banks are highly, highly recommend especially since you will likely be relying on Google Maps for navigation. And for us, we use Apple Pay for most of our purchases. I have a 15,000 mAh battery that can easily charge my iPhone to 100% with battery still remaining on the power bank. 

I recommend getting something at least 10,000 mAH or higher such as this [Anker 313 Power Bank](https://amzn.to/3r2wkcb). 

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Ultra-Compact-High-Speed-VoltageBoost-Technology/dp/B07QXV6N1B?crid=3IL6S6ETL8ICZ&keywords=portable%2Bbattery&qid=1693875354&sprefix=portable%2Bbatt%2Caps%2C188&sr=8-4&th=1&linkCode=li3&tag=budgetconsc07-20&linkId=968bbc7d9832016283ca8208149a26d5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07QXV6N1B&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=budgetconsc07-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=budgetconsc07-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B07QXV6N1B" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Ideally, you want something lightweight, compact, and portable. Your back and shoulder will thank you after a long day of walking and doing touristy things.

### Tip #5: "Cash is King"

Most mom-and-pop restaurants in Flushing and Chinatown accept **cash only**. So break out your Benjamin's from the piggybank! 

On a serious note, smaller denominations ($5s, $10s, $20s), actually, are more convenient as some places may not have the necessary change.
