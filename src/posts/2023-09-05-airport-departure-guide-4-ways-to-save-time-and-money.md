It's nerve wracking going to the airport even for frequent travelers. In this guide, we'll walk you through 4 key aspects of preparing for your flight, making your time at the airport efficient and stress-free.

## 1. How to Get a Discount on Rides to the Airport

When our family members and friends are too busy to take us to the aiport, we usually book an Uber or Lyft. We often find Uber rates to be slightly better, but there's no harm in opening both apps and compare pricing between them.

Note that both the Chase [Freedom Flex/Freedom Unlimited](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/18j/6G84Q2WADR) and [Sapphire Preferred](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6j/OCD838ZVKE) credit cards offer 5% cashback for Lyft, so this is something to take into account to get the most bang for your buck.

## 2. How Early You Should Get to the Airport

For domestic flights, we strive to arrive to the airport at least 2 hours before the **departure time**. 

Our reasoning: 
- 30 minutes for getting tickets and checking in bags (if any)
- 30 minutes waiting in line and going through TSA
- 30 minutes to prepare and board on the plane
- And another 30 minute buffer just in case the lines turn out to be longer than predicted (Missing flights is not fun üòµ‚Äçüí´)

 If you're flying out of LAX or another busy airport, **plan for the worst**! It doesn't hurt to arrive early!

## 3. How to Save Time Checking In

### Airline Mobile Apps

If you're handy with tech, download your airline's mobile app and check in from there to get your boarding pass. There's no need to wait in line.

## 4. How to Get Through TSA Faster

### Put everything in your pockets away

Have your REAL ID or Passport handy in an accessible location (front pockets if you're wearing pants) or somewhere in your bag you can easily access and quickly reach. You don't want to be fumbling around when you get to the security agent. 

Additionally, put everything in your pockets into your bag, backpack, or purse. This includes your phone, wallet, watch, AirPods, or whatever. You just need your boarding pass and your ID. 

This is a system that I've developed over the years of traveling to make it convenient for myself, to reduce travel anxiety, and to expedite going through security. You will no doubt develop your own system. Let us know if any of these travel hacks helped you save time or money on a trip!
