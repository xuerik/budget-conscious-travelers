## Introduction
Nice to meet you all! My name is [Erik](/about), I'm a software engineer 🧑🏻‍💻 by day and a foodie 🤤 by night. My fiance and I are a couple in our 20s, and we're based out of Los Angeles, California. 

We're both *super* passionate about eating delicious food and traveling ❤️. While we do try to live our lives to the fullest, at the same time, we aim to be extremely mindful and conscious of our wallet and, consequently, our finances. 

We will be documenting our travel journey and sharing money-saving tips and hacks we have discovered and learned along the way on our website, {{meta.siteName}}. We hope you all take, at least, a little something away from our blog and apply it to your travels.
