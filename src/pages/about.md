    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Greetings fellow adventurers! I'm Erik and I'm a software engineer at a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp">FAANG company.</a> When I'm not heads down coding away at the keyboard, I love to try and eat delicious and unique food in the local community with my partner, May.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We are both travel enthusiasts and have been to a total of 7 states in the US, and 9 countries around the world together! From the bustling streets of Bangkok to the serene landscapes of Iceland, we enjoy walking around the local communities of each city we've been to and learning the customs of each country.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We will be sharing valuable insights from the places we have gone to, the lessons we learned and the mistakes we made. Read our <a href="/blog">blog</a> to learn more!</p>
